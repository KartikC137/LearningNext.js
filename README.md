This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Example Project which I built to learn various next.js features.

## Getting Started

1. Go to project directory.

```bash
cd first-nextjs-app/next-app
```

2. To run production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start 
```

2. Or run Development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In development server, You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
